    <p class="biography">
      Sarah Mazaraki is a dedicated student-athlete from Sydney, Australia, currently representing Midwestern State University in NCAA Division II tennis. A sophomore pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering, Sarah balances academic excellence with competitive tennis as a key member of the MSU Mustangs women’s team.
      Before joining MSU, Sarah studied at Meriden High School in Sydney, where she developed her passion for tennis and achieved early success on the junior circuit. She later moved to the United States to pursue both academic and athletic opportunities.
      At MSU, Sarah has distinguished herself both on and off the court. In the 2025 season, she formed a highly successful doubles partnership with Sydney Williams, recording a 9–2 win-loss record at the No. 3 position and securing a six-match winning streak. In September 2023, she reached the finals of the "B" draw at the ITA Division II South Central Regional Championships, defeating several higher-ranked players along the way.
      Sarah’s academic achievements match her athletic dedication. She has earned a place on the Dean’s Honor Roll and the Lone Star Conference Commissioner’s Honor Roll, reflecting her commitment to excellence in all areas of university life.
