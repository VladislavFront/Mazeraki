    <p class="biography">
      Anna Maria Mazaraki is a renowned Greek jewelry designer and the founder of the namesake brand, known for making "affordable luxury" accessible to a wide audience. Her journey into the world of jewelry began in 1995, when she started creating unique pieces for her friends, inspired by the idea that jewelry should express a womanâ€™s personality and emotions.
      What began as a creative passion soon transformed into a full-fledged business. Driven by a vision to blend Greek heritage with contemporary design, Anna Maria launched the Anna Maria Mazaraki brand and opened her first store in the Athenian suburb of Halandri.
