    <p class="biography">
      Kharlampiy Vasilievich Mazaraki was a Greek physician, humanitarian, and diplomat who played a pivotal role in the medical and civic life of Jerusalem in the second half of the 19th century. Born in Greece in 1825, he received his medical education in Athens and developed an early interest in infectious disease treatment and community health.
      In the late 1850s, at the invitation of Russian nobleman Boris Mansurov, Mazaraki moved to Jerusalem. There, he became the head of the newly established Russian hospital, where he treated patients suffering from malaria and other infectious diseases. For many years, he was the only physician at Misgav Ladach, and simultaneously led the Greek Hospital while maintaining a private practice.
      In addition to his medical work, Kharlampiy served as the Greek consul in Jerusalem and was entrusted with sensitive diplomatic missions, including assignments in Constantinople. His fluency in languages, diplomatic skills, and unwavering dedication earned him respect across religious and ethnic lines in the city.
